hi ! I made this project by using Simpy and Tkinter other basic functions . the code is being run on py IDLE

Problem Statement: Stopwatch Application with Date and Time Display

Design and implement a stopwatch application that provides the functionality of measuring elapsed time, along with a button to display the current date and time.

Objective: 

The objective of this program is to create a user-friendly stopwatch application with the following features:
- Start Button: The application should allow the user to start the stopwatch, which will begin measuring the elapsed time from the moment it is clicked.
- Stop Button: The application should allow the user to stop the stopwatch, freezing the current elapsed time until the Start Button is clicked again.
- Reset Button: The application should allow the user to reset the stopwatch, setting the elapsed time back to zero.
- Date and Time Button: The application should allow the user to view the current date and time by clicking a button. The date and time information should be displayed in a separate window or printed in the console.

The application should have a graphical user interface (GUI) created using Tkinter, where the elapsed time is displayed in the format "HH:MM:SS.sss" (hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds). The elapsed time should update in real-time, with a minimum update frequency of every 10 milliseconds.

Additionally, the application should provide the functionality to display the current date and time when the corresponding button is clicked. The date and time information should be presented in a human-readable format, including the current date, time, and optionally, other relevant details such as the day of the week.

The overall objective is to create a reliable and user-friendly stopwatch application that accurately measures elapsed time and allows users to conveniently view the current date and time.
