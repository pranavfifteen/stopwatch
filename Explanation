1. `Stopwatch` class: This class encapsulates the stopwatch functionality. It maintains the start time, elapsed time, and provides methods to control the stopwatch.

   - `start()`: Sets the start time of the stopwatch to the current time.
   - `stop()`: Stops the stopwatch and updates the elapsed time by calculating the time difference between the stop time and the start time.
   - `reset()`: Resets the stopwatch by setting the start time to None and the elapsed time to zero.
   - `get_elapsed_time()`: Computes and returns the elapsed time based on the current time and the start time.

2. `update_label()` function: This function runs on a separate thread and continuously updates the GUI label with the current elapsed time.

   - The function takes a `stopwatch` object and a `label` as parameters.
   - It retrieves the elapsed time from the `stopwatch` object and updates the text of the `label` with the formatted elapsed time.
   - The `label.update()` method is called to ensure the label is refreshed in the GUI.
   - The function employs `simpy.rt.sleep()` to introduce a small delay (0.01 seconds) between updates, controlling the frequency of updates.

3. `show_date_time()` function: This function is triggered when the "Show Date and Time" button is clicked. It obtains the current date and time using the `datetime` module and displays it by printing to the console.

4. `main()` function: This is the main entry point of the program. It constructs the GUI window using Tkinter and sets up the necessary components.

   - It initializes a `Stopwatch` object and creates a label to exhibit the elapsed time.
   - Buttons are created for starting, stopping, and resetting the stopwatch, as well as a button to display the current date and time.
   - A separate thread is launched to continuously update the label using the `update_label()` function.
   - The GUI window is then displayed, and the main event loop is started using `root.mainloop()`.

Modifications and enhancements that can be made to the program:

- Extend the functionality by incorporating lap/split time recording.
- Enhance the GUI by customizing the design and layout to improve user experience.
- Implement pause/resume functionality to temporarily halt the stopwatch without resetting the elapsed time.
- Allow users to save and export recorded time data.
- Provide options for users to choose their preferred time format (e.g., 12-hour or 24-hour format).
- Implement keyboard shortcuts for starting, stopping, and resetting the stopwatch.
- Include error handling to gracefully handle exceptions and provide meaningful error messages to users.
- Incorporate a countdown timer feature that allows users to set and track predefined durations.
- Support localization to display the date and time according to the user's preferred format and language.

These suggestions offer avenues for extending and enhancing the stopwatch application. However, the extent of modifications depends on the specific requirements and desired features for the application.
